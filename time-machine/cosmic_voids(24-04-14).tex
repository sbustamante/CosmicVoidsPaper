\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%*************************************************************************


The spatial distribution of galaxies describes a web-like pattern, the 
so-called cosmic web. Today it is understood that such configuration is 
driven by gravitational instabilities. ...

Relevant information about previous works and current state of the art.

\section{The Simulation}
\label{sec:the_simulation}
%*************************************************************************


As it was previously mentioned, we use an unconstrained cosmological 
simulation, the Bolshoi simulation, to identify the possible large scale 
environment of the Local Group. This is a similar approach to the one already 
used by \SRKED{[reference here]}.



The Bolshoi simulation follows the non-linear evolution of a dark matter 
density field on a cubic volume of size $250$\hMpc sampled with $2048^3$ 
particles. The cosmological parameters in the simulation are 
$\Omega_{\rm m}=0.27$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$, $h=0.70$, $n=0.95$ and 
$\sigma_{8}=0.82$ for the matter density, cosmological constant, 
dimensionless Hubble parameter, spectral index of primordial density 
perturbations and normalization for the power spectrum. The mass of each 
particle in the simulation is $m_{\rm p}=1.4\times 10^{8}$\hMsun.
We identify halos with two algorithms, the Friends-of-Friends \SRKED{
[reference here]} algorithm and the Bound Density Maximum algorithm.

\section{Algorithms to quantify the cosmic web}
\label{sec:algorithms_cosmic_web}
%*************************************************************************



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The tidal web (T-web)}
\label{subsec:Tweb}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The first algorithm  we use to identify the cosmic web is based upon the
diagonalization of the tidal tensor, defined as the Hessian of a 
normalized gravitational potential  


%.........................................................................
%Tidal Tensor
\begin{equation}
T_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial x_{\alpha}\partial x_{\beta}}
\end{equation}
%.........................................................................
where the physical gravitational potential has been rescaled by a factor 
$4\pi G\bar{\rho}$ in such a way that $\phi$ satisfies the following 
equation



%.........................................................................
%Poisson
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2\phi = \delta,
\end{equation}
%.........................................................................
where $\bar{\rho}$ is the average density in the Universe, $G$ is the 
gravitational constant and $\delta$ is the dimensionless matter 
overdensity.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The velocity  web (V-web)}
\label{subsec:Vweb}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



We also use a kinematical method to define the cosmic-web environment in 
the simulation. The method has been thoroughly described in XXX and 
applied to study the shape and spin alignment in the Bolshoi simulation 
here XX. We refer the reader to these papers to find a detailed 
description of the algorithm, its limitations and capabilities. Here we 
summarize the most relevant points for the discussion. 



The V-web method for environment finding is based on the local shear 
tensor calculated from the smoothed DM velocity field in the simulation.
The central quantity is the following dimensionless quantity 


%.........................................................................
%V-Web Definition
\eq{V_web}
{
\Sigma_{\alpha\beta} = -\frac{1}{2H_0}\pr{\frac{\partial v_{\alpha}}
{\partial x_{\beta}}+\frac{\partial v_{\beta}}{\partial x_{\alpha}}}
}
%.........................................................................
where $v_{\alpha}$ and $x_{\alpha}$ represent the $\alpha$ component of 
the comoving velocity and position, respectively. $\Sigma_{\alpha\beta}$ 
can be represented by a $3\times 3$ symmetric matrix with real values,
that ensures that is possible to diagonalize and obtain three real 
eigenvalues $\lambda_{1} > \lambda_{2}>\lambda_3$ whose sum (the trace of
$\Sigma_{\alpha\beta}$) is proportional to the divergence of the local 
velocity field smoothed on the physical scale ${\mathcal R}$. 



The relative strength of the three eigenvalues with respect to a threshold
value $\lambda_{th}$ allows for the local classification of the matter 
distribution into four web types: voids, sheets, filaments and peaks, 
which correspond to regions with 3, 2, 1 or 0 eigenvalues with values 
larger than $\lambda_{th}$. Below we shall discuss a novel approach to 
define an adequate threshold value based on the visual impression of void
regions, furthermore we study other possible values based on other visual
features of the cosmic web.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The cosmic web in Bolshoi}
\label{subsec:web_in_simulations}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------



Both established schemes to quantify the cosmic web depend on continuous 
and smooth physical quantities, i.e the peculiar velocity field and the 
density field. To calculate these quantities, a discretization over the 
volume of the simulation is performed, so all the properties are reduced 
to single values associated to discrete cells. According to this, we 
divide the overall volume into $(256)^3$ cells, so each cell has an 
associated comoving cubic volume of $0.98 \mbox{ Mpc h}^{-1}$. Finally, in 
order to reduce possible effects due to the discretization process, a 
gaussian softening is performed between neighbour cells.



Once defined the numerical details about both classification schemes, we
shall analyse the dependence on the threshold value $\lambda_{th}$ for 
each one. For this, we shall use the distribution of dark matter halos as 
tracer of the underlying matter field in order to be more consistent with
available observational data. In the figure \ref{fig:halos_fractions} we 
calculate fractions of halos within each one of the defined environments 
based upon the FOF catalogue of the simulation and for an extensive \lth 
range. Then we look for some key feature that could indicated us a 
possible optimal value of the \lth value. One first step forward our quest 
is the behaviour of the V-web scheme compared with the T-web. As was 
previously established by \SRKED{Hoffman et al. (2012)} and as can be seen 
in the figure \ref{fig:halos_fractions}, V-web scheme is significantly more
sensible to variations of the $\lambda_{th}$ value, since all fractions of
halos for the V-web change significantly in the range $[0,0.4]$, whereas, 
for the T-web scheme, fractions change smoothly throughout all \lth range 
covered. From this, it is then expected that the optimal \lth value for 
the V-web scheme is less than the T-web value.



The more notorious characteristic of the figure \ref{fig:halos_fractions} 
is the behaviour of the fraction of halos within sheet regions for both 
web schemes, increasing until a local maximum, and then decreasing. The 
increasing or decreasing rate of the fraction of halos for some region 
could be interpreted as a measure of the degree of non-linearity of such 
region for some specific \lth value. For example, filaments and knots, 
that are the most non-linear regions of the universe, have a negative rate
for all covered \lth range. In the case of voids, the situation is 
completely opposite, where fractions of halos increase in everywhere. If 
we think in terms of the underlying matter field of the cosmic web, \lth 
is just a cutting parameter between high non-linear regions (filament and 
knots) and low non-linear (voids and sheets). Furthermore, if we take into 
account that dark matter halos are much more likely to form in high 
non-linear regions, it is expected the obtained behaviour of fractions of 
halos for voids, filaments and knots as we increase the \lth value. 
However, the behaviour of the fraction of halos in sheets is less clear,
increasing for low \lth values (like voids) and decreasing for higher \lth 
values (like filaments and knots). This indicates us the transitional 
character of sheet regions in the cosmic web. Our proposal here is to 
select as optimal \lth the value where the fraction of sheets reaches a
local maximum, so sheets are completely taken as intermediate transitional 
and neutral zones regarding the degree of non-linearity. According to this,
we find for the T-web scheme an optimal value $\lambda_{opt}^T = 0.36$ and
for the V-web scheme $\lambda_{opt}^V = 0.20$. In the figure 
\ref{fig:visual_impression} we show the visual impression of the cosmic 
web along with the density field for different \lth values including the 
optimal values. It can be noticed that the optimal values found reproduce 
well the visual impression.



As we have taken halos as tracers of the cosmic web, we analyse 
distributions of mass and peculiar velocity in order to assign typical 
values to each type of environment. In the figure 
\ref{fig:typical_mass_velocity} we calculate both distributions for web 
schemes and using the FOF catalogue of the simulation. Thick lines 
correspond to the median of the distribution and filled regions limited by
dashed lines correspond to quartiles $Q_1$ and $Q_3$, it means, $50\%$ of
all halos are within such regions for every \lth value and for each type 
of environment. We rather use median and quartiles as measure of 
dispersion because there are some very unusual and extreme values that 
makes the usual analysis based upon means and standard deviations less 
reliable.



A first interesting feature of the figure  \ref{fig:typical_mass_velocity} 
is the median mass for each region. In the case of the T-web, although 
dispersions of the distribution of mass for each environment are 
considerably overlapped each other, the median value is very 
well-differentiated among types of environment, indicating that it is 
possible to assign typical values of mass to each region, and being 
consistent with expectations, where low mass halos are typical in voids 
until high mass halos in knots. For the case of the V-web scheme, all
medians and dispersions are completely overlapped, specially for values 
grater than the optimal \lth value, indicating that it is not possible to
assign typical mass ranges to each environment as quantified by this 
scheme. For peculiar velocities, this situation is opposite, where V-web
scheme is much more adequate to assign typical distributions of velocity
to each environment. Although T-web also makes a differentiation in the 
distributions of velocity, this is very slight compared with the V-web 
case. These results can be explained by appealing the physical origin of 
each web scheme. As T-web is based upon the Hessian matrix of the 
potential field, it is expected all quantities related to the potential, 
like density field and distribution of halos mass, are well-differentiated 
among each region, while for the V-web scheme, based upon the shear 
velocity tensor, all dynamical quantities, as the peculiar velocity field 
and the distribution of halos velocity are alike expected to be 
well-differentiated among regions as quantified by this scheme.



Finally, we also calculate typical distributions of the density and 
peculiar velocity fields in each type of environment, obtaining completely
analogous results. Furthermore, we also use a BDM catalogue of the 
simulation, obtaining very similar conclusions.

\section{Finding bulk voids}
\label{sec:bulk_voids}
%*************************************************************************


Following the recent growing interest in studying galaxy formation in 
low-density regions as cosmological tests, we propose an scheme to find 
bulk voids by using the two defined web schemes. Initially, we explore a 
first simple method based on a FOF-like algorithm, where we build an input 
catalogue for the FOF method with the coordinate of the center of every 
cell marked as void according to the web classification scheme adopted, 
setting a linking length to connect diagonal neighbour cells.


Following the work of \SRKED{Forero-Romero et al. 2008}, we also perform a
percolation analysis in order to select the best threshold parameter that
reduces percolation in cells. In the left panels of the figure 
\ref{fig:percolation_analysis_FOF} we show the result of our percolation 
analysis for both web schemes. In both cases, it can be noticed that the 
volume of the largest void region is minimized at $\lambda_{th} = 0.0$, 
what means that percolation is completely reduced for this threshold 
value. However, according to our previous analysis, such value does not 
reproduce the visual appearance of the cosmic web, so it is out of 
consideration.
